# Custom Zork

This game is a test to access the master in Advanced Progamming for AAA Video Games.

## Plot
You are an explorer that has been assigned an important task. You need to deliver a precious Golden Idol to the temple it belongs to. It seems like an easy task, but it won't be that way...

## Map
The map has 9 rooms. In order to get to the temple, the player will have to pick items and choose the best (or safest) way to arrive to the temple.

You can [find the map here](https://github.com/magalenyo/zork/blob/master/zork/map/map.png)

## Items
- **Idol**: the item that needs to get delivered to the temple. The player starts with this item.
- **Rock**: a small-regular size rock. Used to create noise and make go away creatures.
- **Berries**: juicy berries. This can restore some health after a good fight.
- **Key**: a rusty key. This can be used to open a house.
- **Backpack**: a basic backpack. You can store many items inside the backpack.
- **Sword**: sharpen sword. Use it to fight.
- **Coins**: shiny golden coins.

## Gameplay

The user has different endings depending the gameplay style.
- The player can throw a rock away to make the wolves go away and free the path of the wolves to get to the temple.
- The player can fight the wolves, but will get damaged dies before getting to the temple. The user can avoid dying if eats berries before getting to the temple.
- The player can cross the bridge, but has a chance of success. The player reduces the chance of getting to the other side of the river when taking objects. The player can drop objects in order to have a higher chance of crossing the bridge.

If the player gets to the temple without the idol, it will die.

There are variations in the gameplay, in the section **TESTS** there are some examples.
